This folder contains specs for Kiro.

To use Kiro (example, pseudo command):

kiro run .kiro/generate_tests.spec.yaml --repo ./workspace/repo

The Kiro run will create tests at the path specified in outputs.generated_tests_path

For hackathon reproducibility, we include a pre-generated test file in sample_repos/sample_project_a/.kiro/generated_tests.py
